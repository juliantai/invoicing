I want to build a time keeping app with a pdf invoicing feature. 

* allow users to login and create projects with an hourly rate

* under each project they should be able to start and stop a timer which creates a task

* on each task there should be a description field that users can fill out

* users should be able to move tasks up and down and all other crud functionality 

* users can bill their clients once they are done by sending an email that generates a pdf of the times. The tasks should now be moved from the projects into the related invoice.

* clients can respond back to the email, which should take them to a client portal where they can pay the invoice (probably just fake this)

* paid invoices should show up in user portal and clear the task list for project
